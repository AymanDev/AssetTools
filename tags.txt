Material tags that I use with the IQE format:

	doublesided	-- double-sided lighting. implies no backface culling.
	singlesided	-- single-sided lighting. implies no backface culling. used with radial normals.

	shadeless	-- fully emissive color.

	blend		-- normal alpha blending
	additive	-- additive alpha blending. implies shadeless.

	radial		-- radial normals from center of mesh
	r=x,y,z		-- radial normals from coordinate. may be repeated. uses closest coordinate specified for each vertex.

	clamp		-- don't repeat uv
